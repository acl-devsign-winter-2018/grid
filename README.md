Lab: Grid
===

## Lab Instructions
* Create a How-To Page: that is, instruct users on how to do something. Tie their shoes, register to vote, gain more Twitter followers.
* Use [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) to make this How-To Page responsive.
* You may additionally use [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)–the two work well together, after all–but Grid should be the **primary** tool in creating responsiveness.
* Follow the Webpack component architecture we've used on other labs.
* Your How-To should include at least two pages, so implement a multi-page router.
* **Sketch** your responsive layout and text structure before developing. These sketches can be rough.
* Apply the principles of Chapter 3 of *Don't Make Me Think!* to make your page scan-friendly.
